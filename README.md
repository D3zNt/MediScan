# MediScan

## This program is a symptom-based disease diagnosis tool. It allows users to input symptoms and checks against a database of diseases to identify a possible match. The user can add or remove symptoms during the process, and the program will update the diagnosis accordingly. If no disease matches the selected symptoms, it provides an error message and suggests modifying the symptom list. The tool also ensures that at least one symptom matches for a diagnosis to be made.
